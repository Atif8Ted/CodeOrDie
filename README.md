"Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions." http://buff.ly/1tz3gEe


### Problem sets for the programming blitz at KITE

### The Roadmap 
- TEACH - Time, Effort (hard work), ambition (urgent), confidence, heart (passion, interest, [fun][cff])
- The Progression
  - Problem sets
    - PC-1 (looking for contributions, either extend or suggestion for replacement)
    - PC-2
    - Mentor guided sets (and many more, progressively challenging ones) 
  - Lab Reforms 
    - [Nifty][nifty] assignments (personal Facebook, most visited pages in a website, etc)
  - Projects 
    - Coding for [Fun][cff]

### Show and Tell
- We shall use **[Blockly Maze][Maze]** to introduce Loops, Conditionals
  - approx. 60min - 90min
  - Alternative - [HourOfCode][Maze2]

### Problem Sets
_Pre-requisite: A familiarity with standard IO functions like **printf** and **scanf** is recommended, but not mandatory_

- A gentle, low-cognitive, domain-free (almost), progressively challenging coverage of
  the most important **programming constructs** in the C Programming language.

    - [CC-Intro-Local](https://10.100.1.147/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=26,p=957) 
    - [CC-Intro-Ext](https://cloudcoder.kgisl.com/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=26,p=978) 
  - OOPs in C++ Sets
    - Problem sets are available [here](CoDE/oop-local.md) ([here](CoDE/oop.md) for external access)

### Problem Solving through Programming
- Listen to the lectures [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL94CA590D7781A9B9)

### Ultimately
- Reach out to a mentor and do as many challenging [problems][Mentor20] as possible

### Inspiration
- How to learn [Regex](http://regexone.com/lesson/0) in the most elegant manner?
  - what can we learn from this? 
  - How to emulate this?
