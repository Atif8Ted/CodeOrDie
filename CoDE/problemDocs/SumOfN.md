### Sum of 'n' Numbers
_Inspired by a Blockly Bug - http://goo.gl/NU2jT6

Write a C program to find the sum of 'n' consecutive numbers using the `for` loop.
- `n` can also be 0; it does not necessarily have to be a positive value. 

Read the value of 'n' from the standard in using `scanf` statement. Print the intermediary value of the `sum` for each iteration, including the final one.

Example: 

 `5` -> `0 1 3 6 10 15 "`
 
 `7` -> `"0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 "`
