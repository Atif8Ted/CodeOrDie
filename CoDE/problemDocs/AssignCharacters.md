#Assigning Characters
This exercise gets you familiar with character variables and character strings.

1. Read a string of characters (not more than 30) from stdin
  - What kind of variable is suited to do this?
     - `int` or `float` or `char`?
2. Assign the first `four` characters of the string to separate variables
   - What kind of variable type is suited for this?
     - `int` or `float` or `char`?
3. Print the four variables in reverse order
   - Use as many as four `printf` statements

# Example
- `"abcd" -> "d c b a"`
- `"fame" -> "e m a f"`
- `"deed" -> "d e e d"`   // what is the name of a word which reads the same backwards?` 
- `"string" -> "i r t s"`
