### Problem Sets for Iteration 2
_Theme: Programming for Problem Solving_

- Some excellent advice on why you should use a [Code NoteBook](docs/Java%20Rockstar.md)

---
**Variables, Assignments, Arithmetic** _"Memory is everything"_
- TBD 

	 
---
**Sequential** _"Cooking Recipe, step by step"_

- TBD 


---
**Selection/Conditionals** _"Decisions, decisions, decisions..."_

- [FizzBizz]
- [FizzBizzMix] 

---
**Repetitions/Loops** _"Forever and forever..."_

- Find the most frequent [fmf](https://cloudcoder.kgisl.com/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=18,p=868)
  [(int)](https://10.100.1.147/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=18,p=868)

**Function Calls** _"Anything and everything is only one (function) call away!"_

- Is it a Palindrome? [Palindrome](https://cloudcoder.kgisl.com/cloudcoder/#exercise?c=29,p=960)

# 1 & 2  Variables and Sequential
  - Swap the value of two variables
    - without function calls
    - with a function call
  - Vedic Mathematics for speed of light
  - Introduction of Struct - for later list traversal
    - Complex number calculation

#3 Selection / Conditionals
  - LowerThan10 and LowerThanNofM
  - FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzMix
  - Anagrams

#4 Repetition / Loops
  - Find the largest in an array
    - 2nd largest in the array
  - PrimeFactors
  - MakeBricks and MakeChocolates
  - Find the most frequent
  - Anagram generation and Dictionary Lookup (C++)

#5 Subroutines / Functions
  - Pointers 
    - Swapping two numbers using pointers
      - swap variables of any size 
      - dynamic memory allocation
      - string manipulation (from Anton Spraul)
  - Use a function to swap two numbers
    - introduction of a unary operator
    - the same symbol ?
  - List traversal
  Recursion 
  - Fibonacci numbers (non-memoized, and memoized)

**Iteration 3**
 - Get a good mentor;
 - Get more challenging problems
 - Solve it along with him - watch him over his shoulder
