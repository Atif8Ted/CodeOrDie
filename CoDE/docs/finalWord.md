# Fundamental Coding Skills Development
_ Smart Content (through CloudCoder like tools) allows for Spaced Repetition with Instant Feedback (which is the best way to improve retention) at little or no cost._

Domain-free, progressively-challenging introduction to programming is possible with the help of 
  - Blockly's Maze (as a Show and Tell demo + skill development)
  - The right problem sets (carefully crafted, PC-1 and PC-2 are in draft mode)
    - A gentle, low-cognitive, domain-free (_almost_), progressively challenging 
      coverage of the most important **programming constructs** 
      in the C Programming language.
  - The right tool (to present the problem sets as `SmartContent`)
    - CloudCoder is good enough, and allows us to scale
    - `Self-confidence` improves as the tests are passed (`feedback`)
    - Spaced `repetition` of the same content is possible at low cost

  - The right training to faculty mentors (who must have good coding skills)

A **disproportionate** amount of time has been spent on this, starting with Udacity (Sept 15 2012), but the effort has been worth it. Armed with coding skills, the student can definitely hope to have a better learning experience through his engineering curriculum (this applies equally to both circuit and non-circuit branches). Minimally, we have enabled him to think correctly (through programming).

### Next step: Workshops

- PC-1 needs to piloted with a batch of 1st year students
  - College-wide and also extend to KGCAS if required
- PC-2 needs to be piloted with a batch of 1st year students
  - College-wide and year-wise extension 

Students must be encouraged to repeat the PC-1 and PC-2 sets on their own.
Spaced repetition will help retain the skills better.

### Further Action Items

- Further to PC-1, which already presents 4 cycles of going through the constructs, we need to add at least 6 more. This can be developed in PC-2.
  - Ideally, 20 cycles are required to reinforce the concepts into the student's brain

- Experienced coders must be recruited to be lab assistants for the 1st year - they can also be given additional work in `IAS/ KGISL/ KGFSL` to match their compensation expectation
  - They can also be asked to be the resource persons to help out during the PC-Blitz coding camps

- Interested faculty members must be asked to 
  - improve `CloudCoder` (presenting the enhancements as student projects in Java)
  - add and refine the problem sets (based on the feedback from students)

- PDS-1 and PDS-2 Anna University problems
  - Problem sets can be developed to help students solve the PDS-1 and PDS-2 exam banks
