**Iteration 1**
#1 Variables and assignments and arithmetic
Basic Mathematics 
  int four = 2 * 2;
  int five =  5 * 1;
  int six = 3 * 3;
  int seven = 3 + 4;
  int ten = four + six; 
  int another_six = ten - four; 
  float pi = 3.1417; 
  char greeting[40] = "Hello world";

How to test? Need basic **printing** capacity 
  - printf ("%d", 10);
  - printf ("%s", "this is a line"); 
  - printf ("%s", "Hello World");
  - printf("%s", greeting);
  - printf("%d", six);
  - printf("%d", another_six);

#2 Sequential
  - Read a name, and then Greet the name
  - read two names, and then greet both the names
  - Read three names, and then greet all the three names
  - Transfer between three variables

#3 Selection / Conditionals
  - if Man's name - then "Mr"
  - if woman's name - then "Mrs"

#4 Repetition  / Loops
  - Print a greeting a 12,000 times
  - Every 1000th greeting, print "Hello India!"

#5 Subroutines / Functions
  - Use a function to print a greeting
  - Palindrome greeting checker
    - introduction of Sequential types and indexing

#### "Hello World" - as a Lead into Iteration_2
  - command line variables
  - function call main(), subroutine calls to printf()
  - return values 
  - include files

**Iteration 2 **
# 1 & 2  Variables and Sequential
  - Swap the value of two variables
    - without function calls
    - with a function call
  - Vedic Mathematics for speed of light
  - Introduction of Struct - for later list traversal
    - Complex number calculation

#3 Selection / Conditionals
  - LowerThan10 and LowerThanNofM
  - FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzMix
  - Anagrams

#4 Repetition / Loops
  - Find the largest in an array
    - 2nd largest in the array
  - PrimeFactors
  - MakeBricks and MakeChocolates
  - Find the most frequent
  - Anagram generation and Dictionary Lookup (C++)

#5 Subroutines / Functions
  - Pointers 
    - Swapping two numbers using pointers
      - **swap** variables of any size 
      - dynamic memory allocation
      - string manipulation (from Anton Spraul)
  - Use a function to swap two numbers
    - introduction of a unary operator
    - the same symbol ?
  - List traversal
  Recursion 
  - Fibonacci numbers (non-memoized, and memoized)

**Iteration 3**
 - Get a good mentor and ask him to coach you on more [challenges][Mentor20] 
   - Stroustrup: "A good mentor is the best help a student can have; 
                 maybe that's why they are not easy to find.‚Äù 
                 http://buff.ly/Z4kqLr #4thR
- Get more challenging problems
	- Solve it along with him 
 		- watch him over his shoulder
