### Analogy 1
Programming is as easy as Cooking. In cooking, you need ingredients, and you need a sequence of steps to blend those ingredients together. What are the three things you need 
in programming?
  - A Recipe (algorithm) 
    - Ingredients (memory variables)
    - Steps (sequence of operations) 
       - a combination of conditionals (when temp > 100, switch off) and repetitions (keep stirring until thick....)
 
### Analogy 2
Just as there are 7 fundamental notes to the music system, there are 
7 fundamental constructs for programming. 

- Memory Variables, Assignments and Arithmetic (using operators)
- Sequential 
  - Conditionals
  - Loops (parameterized Conditionals)
  - Function calls (parameterized Loops and/or conditionals and functions)
    - Indirection (special parameters, using pointers, Arrays)
    - Recursion (when a function calls itself)

### What is Programming?
Programming is about writing code in a specific language to implement an algorithm (solution) for a problem. 
- An algorithm is nothing but a Sequential set of operations involving 
  - values (stored in memory, using assignments) and 
  - decisions about those values (conditionals). 

### Constructs
- Sequence
  - Assignments (to memory variables using operators), 
    - conditionals (sometimes implemented either with loops and/or functions)
