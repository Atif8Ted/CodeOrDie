# Learn to Program
Why Programming? Why Python? Why Now? http://buff.ly/1pWqAnf
_"Programming is the Missing Link in Education"_

- But why? 
 - Make good money
    - When can I make good money?
      - When you are good at something
        - How to be a good programmer?
          - Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get                paid, but because it is **fun** to program http://buff.ly/1pwwTxC
  - Because it can be good money and good fun!

- How to?
  - Make a commitment to write 100 lines of code a day
    - Refactor, refactor, refactor
  - On your own (> Sept 2012 - _MOOCs and Udacity and Python_)
    - Blockly (low cognitive load, syntax-free) - [On Quora](http://goo.gl/6kjkXG)
      - [Spherly](http://outreach.cs.ua.edu/spherly/)
    - IIT-Kanpur and NASSCOM - online course on C and C++ and DataStructures
    - CS101 (Udacity, Python)
    - Work on problems in ([CloudCoder](http://bit.ly/primeKG))
    - CodeWars (Katas and ranks)

## Programming Constructs
**Turing** and his 6 Primitive operations: "Computation must allow repetitive actions - do action A over and over until a certain condition is met. This amounts to staying in a state (and moving the tape head left or right) until a certain condition is met. Computation must also allow adaptive actions - if a certain condition is met, do action A; otherwise do action B. This is captured by state transitions according to the contents of the tape head at a particular location." http://buff.ly/1uoyBaW

### 1 Variables, Assignments, Arithmetic
Memory is everything! 
 - Simple types 
   - int, char, double, float, pointers, structs, data structures
   - library defined, user-defined - classes (OO)
     - String (c++)
   - Generics - Vectors, Maps, Sets (OO)
   - File IO (long term memory)
 
 - Sequences types
   - Strings, Arrays
   - command line arguments
 - Operators
   - Unary, Binary, Ternary

### 2 Sequential (algorithms)
 - Everything is like a cooking recipe
   - steps, steps, steps

### 3 Selection
  - Conditionals
  - Ternary Operator

### 4 Repetition / Iteration
 - For Loops
 - While Loops 
   - Do-While Loops
 
### 5 Subroutines
  - Functions / subroutines / Methods (OO)
  - Basic I/O
    - standard in/out
  - Parameter Passing 
    - Indirection
      - Pointers
  - Recursion
